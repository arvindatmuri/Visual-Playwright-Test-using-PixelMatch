# Installing HandleBars

Handlebars.js is a popular JavaScript templating engine that simplifies the process of dynamically rendering HTML content. It provides a concise and expressive syntax for creating templates, allowing developers to generate HTML markup efficiently and maintainably.

It uses a template and an input object to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions.

`<p>{{firstname}} {{lastname}}</p>`


A handlebars expression is a `{{`, some contents, followed by a `}}`. When the template is executed, these expressions are replaced with values from an input object.
